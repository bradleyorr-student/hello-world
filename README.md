# hello-world

Hey everyone! :smile:

My name is Bradley and this is my repo that I am creating. I am currently a CS major at BSU and I am very excited to learn how to use Github efficiently. 

This is where I plan to store ideas, resources, and even share and discuss things with others.

Here is a [link](www.linkedin.com/in/bradley-orr-14177a15a) to my LinkedIn page.
